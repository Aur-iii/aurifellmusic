If I Were A Ghost releases in JUST 2 days!!!!

This song came about from a melody and chords I got while sitting in piano class, and I didn't have any other inspiration... but after a few days of this melody nagging me to do something with it, I finally knew what to do with it!

I hope you enjoy this song as much as I do.

Stay cozy <3
